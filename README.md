## Code Examples üê±‚Äçüíª
here are some code examples for developers to have an overview about our implementation

#### register for a new user:
```javascript
// Create a new user instance and save it in the database

 const user = new UserModel({ username, password, type });
 await user.save();
```
#### login:
```javascript
// Extract user information from the request body
const { name, password } = req.body;

// Find the user in the database
const user = await UserModel.findOne({ username: name });

// Compare the provided password with the user's stored password
const passwordMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

// Create a token for the user and send it to the browser
const token = createToken(user.username);
res.cookie('jwt', token, { httpOnly: true, maxAge: maxAge * 1000 });
return res.status(201).json({ token: token });

```

#### book an appointment:
```javascript
 // Create a new appointment
const appointment = new AppointmentModel({ doctorId, patientId, date, status, type });

// Update and save the doctor's schedule by removing the booked slot
const updatedDoctor = await DoctorModel.findOneAndUpdate(
  { "_id": doctorId },
  { $pull: { availableSlots: date } },
  { new: true }
);

// Save the appointment
await appointment.save();


```
#### view health records:
```javascript
// Retrieve patient information from the database using user ID
const patientId = req.params.patientId;
const patient = await PatientModel.findOne({ user: res.locals.userId });

// Send back the health records associated with the patient
const patientRecords = patient.health_records;
res.status(200).json(patientRecords);

```

## Configuration

### 1. Database Connection

Before running the project, make sure to set up your database connection by adding your MongoDB connection string to the `.env` file located in the `server` directory. Here's an example:
